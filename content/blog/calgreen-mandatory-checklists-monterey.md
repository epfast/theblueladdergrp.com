## Why This Matters

Do you remember the energy crisis of the 1970s?

California's response was the creation of the California Energy Commission (CEC) in 1978 — an agency dedicated to ensuring energy efficiency and building performance statewide.

From that mission came **Title 24**, the comprehensive energy code that affects every new building and remodel in the state. Whether you love it or hate it, Title 24 is the law, designed to reduce energy waste and make California's buildings more efficient.

And nestled within Title 24 is **Part 11 — CALGreen, the California Green Building Standards Code.**

## The CALGreen Checklist

The California AIA (American Institute of Architects) has published the updated **2022 CALGreen Mandatory Measures Checklists**, available free in both PDF and CAD formats:

These checklists are essential for all residential and commercial projects. But here's the catch — **they must be completed by a licensed ICC Certified CALGreen Plans Examiner and Inspector.**

## A Flaw in the System

In the City of Monterey, CALGreen checklists are often submitted incomplete or not project-specific — and yet permits are still issued. This creates a dangerous gap in compliance. I've personally seen multiple projects in Monterey receive permits without proper CALGreen review.

When I contacted the City's Chief Building Official about this issue, their response was:

> "Thank you for the reminder. We will be sure to reach out to our plan review team and remind them that these checklists need to be filled out uniquely as they apply to each project."

While appreciated, that doesn't exactly inspire confidence.

## So Who's Responsible?

Ultimately, the **property owner** — whether a homeowner, developer, or owner-builder — is responsible for CALGreen compliance. That's where most people get caught off guard. You've made it to the final inspection, ready for your Certificate of Occupancy, when the inspector asks:

> "Where is your CALGreen certification by an ICC Certified CALGreen Inspector?"

Without it, you **cannot occupy the building.**

By that point, you've likely missed two crucial inspections:

1. The foundation/concrete pour inspection  
2. The interim (all-trades) inspection  

## Real-World Risks of Skipping CALGreen

### Moisture in Framing Materials

Framing lumber with more than **16% moisture** can lead to hidden mold growth inside your walls. Once covered, it's invisible for years — until it becomes a costly and hazardous problem.

### Uncovered HVAC Ducts During Construction

If HVAC ducts aren't sealed during finish work, dust, insulation fibers, and debris accumulate inside your ventilation system. When you finally move in and turn on your HVAC, that's what you and your family breathe.

This isn't hypothetical — I personally contracted a chronic lung disease in 2016 due to jobsite air contamination. These hazards are real. That's why **CALGreen checklist compliance is mandatory in Monterey.**
